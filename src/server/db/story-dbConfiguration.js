Markdown can be used in the text content of a text block, or in the heading or description fields of any story block (i.e. text, image, video, audio). You are free to use it in any way you wish, in any of these fields.\n\n\nFor our purposes here, we describe how to embed a link into text content using markdown, since this is currently the only way to embed a link in your story. We are working on more user-friendly ways of adding links, and your feedback and ideas are welcome!\n\n\nTo create a link, the **link text** (what the reader will see and select) is put in square brackets, followed by the **link address** in round brackets, with no space between them, like so:\n\n\n`[Learn more about the IDRC](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/)`\n\n\nWhich will appear as:\n[Learn more about the IDRC](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/)\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add a **link title** in quotes following the link address, which in some browsers will appear on hover, and will be read by screen readers. This can help give your readers a better idea of where the link is going to take them. In this example, “IDRC Website” is the title. Be sure to include a space between the link address and the title, like so:\n\n\n`[Learn more about the IDRC](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/ \"IDRC Website\")`\n\n\nWhich will appear in your story as:\n[Learn more about the IDRC](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/ \"IDRC Website\")\n\n\n[This article by the Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/title-attribute/ \"Using the Title Attribute to Help Users Predict Where They Are Going\") describes the use of link titles in detail."

To focus on a block, you can click/touch anywhere within the block or navigate to it with the keyboard.\n#### Auto-saving\n* At the moment, files (such as videos, images or audio clips) will not be saved with your story. If you close the Story Tool and return, only the text content of your story will be reloaded. You will have to add them back in again after loading your story.\n* Text entered into an active text field will not be saved until you navigate out of that text field.\n"
